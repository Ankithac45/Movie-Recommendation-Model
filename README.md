# Movie-Recommendation-Model
This is a Basic Movie Recommender system which uses machine learning,Python  which will recommend best movies based on user inputs.
This is the final project for Machine Learning PESU IO Course

# Data Description
We will work with two datasets. One is Credits, and the other is Movies The dataset is taken from Kaggle, it is called TMDB data i.e. The Movie Database. You can download the dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

# Steps:
Step 1:Load the Libraries

Step 2:Load the DataSet

Step 3:Get the basic information of Data

Step 4:Load the second dataset : Movies Dataset

Step 5:Basic information about Dataset

Step 6:Merge the two Dataframes

Step 7:Minimum votes to be listed

Step 8:Getting list of movies to be listed

Step 9:Defining a function

Step 10:Sort the movies

Step 11:Get High Budget Movies, Most Popular Movies, High Revnue Movies

Step 12:Drop the title_y from the data frame

Step 13:Overview Column

Step 14:Get Recommendations as per the input movie


# Contributions of team members:
Ankitha C : worked on pandas library and loaded the dataset , cosine similarity

Tulasi L : merged two datasets into one

Shrujan Dev : sorted the movies based on parameters like most popular , high budget movies and revenue.

Prashanth : recommended movies based on overview column i.e description of movie

# What we have Learned :
we have picked up many new skills for this project.

Numpy , Pandas Libraries

Dealing with Errors

Storing data in datframe, merging datframes and sorting them

Cosine Similarity

Note: We have referred and utilized many resources in web like youtube to build up this project.

# A Special Thanks our IO SME
